should.js deprecated assertions

## Install

```bash
$ npm install should-deprecated
```

```
require('should-deprecated');
```

That row patch your should instance adding assertions. With mocha you can use it via `-r` switch.

## include(obj)

Assert that the given `obj` is present via `indexOf()`,
so this works for strings, arrays, or custom objects implementing indexOf.
Also it can assert if given object will have some sub-object.

Assert array value:

```javascript
[1,2,3].should.include(3)
[1,2,3].should.include(2)
[1,2,3].should.not.include(4)
```
Assert substring:

```javascript
'foo bar baz'.should.include('foo')
'foo bar baz'.should.include('bar')
'foo bar baz'.should.include('baz')
'foo bar baz'.should.not.include('FOO')
```
Assert object includes another object:

```javascript
var tobi = { name: 'Tobi', age: 1 };
var jane = { name: 'Jane', age: 5 };
var user = { name: 'TJ', pet: tobi };

user.should.include({ pet: tobi });
user.should.include({ pet: tobi, name: 'TJ' });
user.should.not.include({ pet: jane });
user.should.not.include({ name: 'Someone' });
```
## includeEql(obj)

Assert that an object equal to the given `obj` is present in an Array:

```javascript
[[1],[2],[3]].should.includeEql([3])
[[1],[2],[3]].should.includeEql([2])
[[1],[2],[3]].should.not.includeEql([4])
```
